# Aldeamo GCP K8s Infrastructure

This project automates the provisioning, deployment, and secure exposure of a Kubernetes application using Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes (GKE).

It includes end-to-end infrastructure management, a TLS-terminating NGINX reverse proxy, and rate-limiting for incoming traffic.
